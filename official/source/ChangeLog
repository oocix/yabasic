  - return from within a switch statement is now possible

Version 2.712:
  - The new Option '-check' can be used to check for
    compatibility with previous versions of yabasic
  - The instr(a$,b$)-function now returns 0, if
    b$ is the empty string

  - Various bugfixes related with: print using,token$()

Version 2.690: 
  - implemented logical shortcuts, i.e. conditions within
    if or while statements are only evaluated as far as needed.
  - New form of the open statement: open "foo" for reading as #1
  - New form of the open function: open(a,"foo") intended for use
    in if-statements: 
      if (not open(a,"foo")) print "Shit !"
  - The same time an old variant of open within if has gone:
      if (not open a,"foo") print "Shit !"
    is no longer valid.
  - You may now write: print #a "Hello"
  - Finally: there is no distinction between expressions and conditions
    any more, i.e. wihin the condition of an if-statement you may
    now use arbitrary expressions; even something like this:
      if (cos(x)) print "Strange"
  - Fixed a bug with printing under Windows: The screen now scrolls up
    if the cursor has reached the bottom

Version 2.681: Finished the work started with 2.680; yabasic can now
  parse its own demo again correctly.

Version 2.680: Essentially removed the distinction between expressions
  and conditions, i.e. you may write things like this:
    okay=(1<10) : if (okay) print "Hallo"
  Included the man page with the distribution. Thanx to Dejan Lekic !

Version 2.671: Bugfix, yabasic will now build under hpux.

Version 2.670: Changed the scheme of version numbers: 2.67 Release 0 is now 2.670

  have all the standard GNU make targets: make check, make install, make uninstall.
